- Have Git CMD installed

- then run the following command:
- git clone https://github.com/x00202506/Visualisation_CA2.git

- code .


- I used Live Server for this CA, so make sure you have that installed as an extension.
- When the extention is installed, go to index.html and click "Go Live" to Open my Web Page
- There is both a Light mode and Dark mode for my web page
- The Hosted URL can be found on the web page also (In the exact way the CA instructions ask)
- I have it here in the README.md file below also just in case:
